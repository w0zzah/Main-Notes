        Adds the given letter and frequency combination as a FreqNode object

        frequency is added to its frequency.

        If the updated frequency is greater than the frequency of the previous
        node then it should be moved into order, ie, so that it is after
        all items with the same or greater frequency.

        If the letter is not in the list then the new frequency object should be
        added to the list so that it is after all letters
        with the same or higher frequency.

        Adding new letters with frequency 1 should be the sole usage case in
        this assignment and you can make your code more efficient if you treat
        letters with frequency of 1 as a special case. But, your code should
        still deal with the more general case, eg, my_list.add('a', 4)

        Of course, if there are no letters in the list
        then the new item should be added at the head.

        The example below should make it clear how this method should work.
        Hint: you should have code similar to this in your answers to lab 3 :)
